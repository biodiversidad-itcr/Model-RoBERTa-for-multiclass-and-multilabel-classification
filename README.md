# Multiclass and Multilabel Classification with RoBERTa

## Description

### RoBERTa_Multiclass_Classification.ipynb
The project aims to implement a text classification model based on the RoBERTa architecture, adapted to handle multiple classes. It covers the entire process from data loading and preparation to training, evaluation, and model usage for predictions.

### Next Notebook

## Features

- **RoBERTa Model**: Uses the RoBERTa architecture for text classification.
- **Multiclass**: Capable of classifying text into multiple categories.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes examples of text cleaning and preparation for NLP models.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Provides model training configuration and performance metrics.
- **GPU Support**: Configured to leverage GPU acceleration when available (e.g., A100 GPU).
